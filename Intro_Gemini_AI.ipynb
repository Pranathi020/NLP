This allows you to sort based on specific attributes, calculations, or any other criteria you define.  Lambda functions are often used inline for simple key functions.\n",

            "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to handle the vanishing gradient problem, a common challenge in training standard RNNs. This problem makes it difficult for RNNs to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.\n",

            "* **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Foundation:** LSTMs are a type of RNN, meaning they process sequential data one element at a time, maintaining a \"memory\" of past inputs.  This makes them suitable for tasks like:\n",
            "    * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, text generation.\n",
            "    * **Time Series Analysis:**  Stock price prediction, weather forecasting.\n",
            "    * **Speech Recognition:** Converting audio to text.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **The Vanishing Gradient Problem:**  In standard RNNs, gradients (used to update the network's weights during training) can become extremely small as they are backpropagated through many time steps.  This makes it difficult for the network to learn dependencies between inputs that are far apart in the sequence.\n",
            "\n",

            "    * **Cell State (Ct):** The \"memory\" of the LSTM.  It carries information across time steps.  Think of it as a conveyor belt that transports relevant information through the sequence.\n",
            "    * **Hidden State (ht):**  The output of the LSTM cell at a particular time step.  It contains information about the current input and the past cell state.\n",
            "    * **Gates:**  These are neural networks that control the flow of information into and out of the cell state.  They decide what information to keep, what to forget, and what to update. There are three main types of gates:\n",

            "        * **Forget Gate (ft):**  Determines what information to discard from the cell state. It looks at the current input (xt) and the previous hidden state (ht-1) and outputs a value between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state.  A value of 0 means \"completely forget this,\" while a value of 1 means \"completely keep this.\"\n",
            "        * **Input Gate (it):**  Determines what new information to store in the cell state.  It has two parts:\n",

            "            * A tanh layer that creates a vector of new candidate values, Ĉt, that could be added to the cell state.\n",
            "        * **Output Gate (ot):**  Determines what information to output as the hidden state.  It filters the cell state based on the input and previous hidden state.  It uses a sigmoid layer to decide which parts of the cell state to output. Then, it applies a tanh function to the cell state and multiplies it by the output of the sigmoid gate.\n",
